cartel :Mexico's Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora says 5,376 people have been murdered in drug cartel-related violence this year. And he says the violence is likely to grow worse before it peaks.
corruption :The cartels are not only using violence as an implement to achieve their aims, they also have vast amounts of money at their fingertips, which Mexican authorities say they are using as a multi-pronged weapon of corruption.
determination :When your face them with determination, this is how you build trust and this is what we are doing with the invaluable support of the U.S. Department of Justice and the DEA.
