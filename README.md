# Scripts for Studies

The archive format specification of `StudyArch`, which is supported by
Studies, can be found [here](http://www.studiesapp.com/studyarch/).

This repository is a collection of scripts to create Studies stacks.

First copy the example `.env` file and edit it.

    cp env.example .env

Create a virtual environment

    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

Then install dependencies using `pip`

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## English Words

Create `out/Words.csv` from a words file.

    .venv/bin/python gen_dict.py words.txt

Where each line in the words file is a word to learn. An example can be added
by separated it with `:` from the word.

The csv file can be imported into Anki.

There is also a script to extract words from Kindle vocabulary builder

    .venv/bin/python gen_kindle_vocabulary.py

And eudic exported vocabulary book:

    .venv/bin/python gen_eudic_vocabulary.py eudic-exported.html

## Eudic Vocabulary Management

Move the words in `words.txt` to the Archive book. Use this for words generated by `gen_eudic_vocabulary.py`.

    python add_to_eudic.py --book Archive --move words.txt

Add the words in `words.txt` to the Kindle book. Use this for words generated by `gen_kindle_vocabulary.py`

    python add_to_eudic.py --book Kindle words.txt
